# Azure Bastion Service Terraform module

The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that provision inside the virtual network. It provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to the virtual machines directly in the Azure portal over TLS. When connecting via Azure Bastion, the virtual machines do not need a public IP address.

Azure Bastion deployment is per virtual network, not per subscription/account or virtual machine. Once provisioned an Azure Bastion service in the virtual network, the RDP/SSH experience is available to all the VMs in the same virtual network.

## Module Usage

```hcl
module "azure-bastion" {
  source  = "kumarvna/azure-bastion/azurerm"
  version = "1.0.0"

  # Resource Group, location, VNet and Subnet details
  resource_group_name  = "rg-shared-westeurope-01"
  virtual_network_name = "vnet-shared-hub-westeurope-001"

  # Azure bastion server requireemnts
  azure_bastion_service_name          = "mybastion-service"
  azure_bastion_subnet_address_prefix = ["10.5.0.0/26"]

  # Adding TAG's to your Azure resources (Required)
  tags = {
    ProjectName  = "demo-internal"
    Env          = "dev"
    Owner        = "user@example.com"
    BusinessUnit = "CORP"
    ServiceClass = "Gold"
  }
}
```

## Pre-requisites

### Virtual network

You can create a new virtual network in the portal during this process, or use an existing virtual network to create Azure bastion service. If you are using an existing virtual network, make sure the existing virtual network has enough free address space to accommodate the Bastion subnet requirements.

### Subnet

The subnet will be dedicated to the Bastion host and must be named as `AzureBastionSubnet`. This subnet must be at least `/27` or larger.  User-defined routing (UDR) is not supported on an Azure Bastion subnet. For scenarios that include both Azure Bastion and Azure Firewall/Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) in the same virtual network, you donâ€™t need to force traffic from an Azure Bastion subnet to Azure Firewall because the communication between Azure Bastion and your VMs is private.

### Public IP address

The public IP of the Bastion resource on which RDP/SSH will be accessed (over port 443). Create a new public IP, or use an existing one. The public IP address must be in the same region as the Bastion resource you are creating.  Public IP address SKU by default to `Standard` and Azure Bastion uses/supports only the Standard Public IP SKU with a static assignment.
